"""An e-commerce website uses a robot for its shipping process. There is a row of bins,
where each bin contains a certain number of packages, and a robot stands at the end of the row.
The robot can move to any bin and back again, picking up a maximum of 1 package from each bin
along the way, which are then shipped. Moving the distance of 1 bin and back requires 1 unit of time.
Also, the process of loading and unloading 1 package requires 1 unit of time. Given the number of
bins and how many packages are in each one, what is the minimum amount of time the robot needs to
remove all of the packages from the bins?"""
