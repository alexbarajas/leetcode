"""A computing cluster has multiple processors, each with 4 cores. The number of tasks to
handle is equal to the total number of cores in the cluster. Each task has a predicted
execution time, and each processor has a specified time when its cores become available.
Assuming that exactly 4 tasks are assigned to each processor and that those tasks run
independently (asynchronously) on the cores of the chosen processor, what is the earliest
time that all tasks can be processed."""
