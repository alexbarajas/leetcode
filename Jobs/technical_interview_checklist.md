Steps for technical interviews
1. Ask for clarifications: what do inputs look like, what about what negative/really large numbers look like, does string include symbols, etc...
   1. write these down as comments
2. always start off by mentioning edge cases for a problem
   1. negative values
   2. null/empty values or spaces
   3. arrays and/or data structures of certain sizes
   4. data structures with multiple types of values
   5. smallest/largest possible values
   6. 
3. think and speak out loud
   1. bring up at least 2 different approaches
   2. talk about the complexity of approach
   3. talk about trade-offs and assumptions
   4. ask the interviewer if your thoughts sound good
4. don't start coding until you and the interviewer both agree on an approach to the problem along with which algorithm to use
5. start coding
6. once you finish coding
   1. run through an example by using a test case and go through the code line by line using your test case while speaking out loud
   2. mention why some edge cases fail using your code
