Work Experience

Axoni
1. Develop software to send equity swap payloads using Python, resulting in a 96% decrease in time for sending 1000 trades from 5 minutes to 12 seconds by utilizing concurrency with asyncio 
   1. When I was given the project I noticed that trends were arriving to the V1 version of the platform, so I started looking up ways on how to make them more efficient which led me to concurrency
2. Direct a team of 3 for the development of the Veris V3 equity swap dashboard UI/UX, improving user efficiency by 30% by optimizing the PostgreSQL queries needed for the different payload types to be visible on the trading platform
   1. I speak with the product managers on what the clients are looking for in the UI, so I delegate tasks between the 3 team members to try and get it done as quickly as possible.
   2. I handle the backend to make sure the types of trades the clients are wanting are possible and occasionally take care of the UI to make sure everything is showing up as expected
   3. Tasks are delegated based on what is keeping me occupied at the moment
3. Formulate a comprehensive testing strategy for the Veris V3 UI, utilizing the Cypress framework to address clients' specific requirements, resulting in improved product quality and increased client satisfaction
   1. After getting new requests from the product manager speaking to the clients, I try to replicate those trades and then create automated test scripts using Cypress which sends in the trades via API and verifies the UI using JavaScript
4. Enhance existing documentation for projects and adapt content based on product updates and user feedback allowing for new hires to get involved in their project the same week they are hired
   1. I try to make the documentation as easy to follow so that even someone that just started working here today can easily jump in and start helping out since the repository is easy to read

Personal Projects

Net Worth
1. I created this project because I started tracking my net worth when I graduated, and as I was getting more financial accounts just as a 401k or brokerage account, I saw myself having to log in to every site at the end of every week. This got very repetitive and wasted a lot of my time, so I started tracking my portfolio using this program. It started off as a basic portfolio track, but as I've learned more about programming I added many features using various financial institute APIs, machine learning to estimate my future net worth and cloud hosting so that I can update my data via a mobile phone.
